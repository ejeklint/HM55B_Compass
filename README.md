## A Digital Compass Library for Arduino

HM55B_Compass is an Arduino library that makes access to the digital compass module from [Parallax](http://www.parallax.com/tabid/768/ProductID/98/Default.aspx) super simple. There is another solution in the [Arduino Playground](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/HM55B) which has great information on how to connect the module, but it's makes your code more cluttered. This library should run a tiny little bit faster and waste a few precious bytes less.

After installing the library (see [here](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries) on how to install contributed libraries), use it as simple as this:

	#include <HM55B_Compass.h>

	// Create an instance of compass. Clock on pin 8, Enable on pin 9, dataIO on pin 10.
	HM55B_Compass compass(8, 9, 10);

	void setup() {
	  Serial.begin(57600);
	  // Initialize the module before first use.
	  compass.initialize();
	}

	void loop() {
	  // Read uncalibrated compass value. This takes ~45 ms.
	  // Gives angle +/- 180Â° from north. Negative values to east,
	  // positive to west.
	  int angle = compass.read();
	  // NO_VALUE will be returned if the measuring failed.
	  if (angle == HM55B_Compass::NO_VALUE) {
	    Serial.println("Uh-oh");
	  }
	  else {
	    Serial.println(angle);
	  }
	}


Next version, if there will be one, will support calibration. This is needed in appliances that contain disturbances in the magnetic field.

_Enjoy!_
